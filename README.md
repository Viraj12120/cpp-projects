Space-invaders
Introduction
Space Invader is a classic 2D arcade game developed in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The objective of the game is to control a spaceship and shoot down waves of invading aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. The player must avoid enemy projectiles and try to achieve the highest score possible.

Features
Simple and intuitive controls: Use arrow keys to move the spaceship left and right, and the spacebar to shoot.
Multiple levels: The game progresses through increasing difficulty levels with faster and more aggressive enemies.
Scoring: Earn points for each alien you destroy. The more aliens you eliminate, the higher your score.
Lives: The player starts with a limited number of lives. If an alien reaches the bottom of the screen or collides with the player's spaceship, a life is lost.
Sound Effects: Enjoy retro-style sound effects that enhance the gaming experience.
